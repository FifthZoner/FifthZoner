### Hi, I’m @FifthZoner, also known as Szymon Jabłoński
#### Welcome to my profile, Here you can my attempts at creating things using a keyboard.

I recommend checking out my newest work, such as dodo-lang, as the newer a project is, the better it's written. Of course if you don't mind encountering unspeakable coding horrors you're welcome to search my older work.

#### As for who I am:

I'm currently a student at Rzeszów University of Technology, doing an engineering degree in information engineering. My favourite projects revolve around low level solutions, involving languages such as C, C++ and assembly. I'm not scared of working under different operating systems having used Windows and Linux for a long time also a very very <sub>little of mac os</sub>. If need be I can also work on backends of applications in other technologies and have some understanding of computer graphics (not to be mistaken with frontend of web apps). </br>
In addition to that I like to undertake electronics projects based on arduino, stm32 and raspberry pi (more in the future!) and can tinker with electronics. I possess an <em>extensive</em> knowledge about FDM 3D printing. I'm the proud owner and constructor of 2 voron printers: V2.5459 and V0.3389 and am starting my adventures in the land of resin.
