### Hi, I’m @FifthZoner, aka Szymon Jabłoński
Welcome to my profile, Here you can find many of the progressively finer examples of my programming abilities.

I'm an IT student at Rzeszów University of Technology, my favourite branch of programming is building low level solutions, for embedded, native applications and whatnot, but I'm not scared of creating web backends and others.
